		<!-- Beginner Exercises -->
		<section class="exercise-category">
			<h2>Beginner Exercises</h2>
			<div class="exercise">
				<h3>Push-Ups</h3>
				<img src="pushups.png" alt="Push-Ups">
				<p>Start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor, then push back up. Make sure your back is straight and you are keeping your core engaged as you do your pushups. There are so many different forms of pushups and I suggest you try different variations that target different parts of your chest.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="exercise">
				<h3>Bodyweight Squats</h3>
				<img src="squats.png" alt="Bodyweight Squats">
				<p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if sitting in a chair. Keep your back straight and chest up. Then rise up back to your starting position. This may be hard for some so you can squat into a chair and work your way up to deeper squats and eventually with a weighted vest.</p>

		<!-- Intermediate Exercises -->
		<section class="exercise-category">
			<h2>Intermediate Exercises</h2>
			<div class="exercise">
				<h3>Tricep Dips</h3>
				<img src="dips.png" alt="Tricep Dips">
				<p>Find a stable surface like a bench or chair. Place your hands behind you, fingers facing forward. Lower your body by bending your elbows, then push back up. Keep your back close to the chair or bench and keep your knees straight. This is a great workout for your arms.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="exercise">
				<h3>Pull-Ups</h3>
				<img src="pullups.png" alt="Pull-Ups">
				<p>Hang from a pull-up bar or a pole with your palms facing away from you. Pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar, then lower yourself back down. Keep your core tight and avoid swinging, this will keep your back engaged.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<!-- Advanced Exercises -->
		<section class="exercise-category">
			<h2>Advanced Exercises</h2>
			<div class="exercise">
				<h3>Handstand Push-Ups</h3>
				<img src="handstandpushups.png" alt="Handstand Push-Ups">
				<p>Kick into a handstand position against a wall. Lower your body by bending your elbows, then push back up. Keep your core engaged and maintain balance throughout the exercise. Pretty difficult workout but with time you can learn it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="exercise">
				<h3>Muscle-Ups</h3>
				<img src="muscleups.png" alt="Muscle-Ups">
				<p>Start with a pull-up motion, then transition to a dip motion by pushing your chest over the bar. Lower yourself back down and repeat. This exercise requires significant upper body strength and technique and it takes the most time to learn.</p>
