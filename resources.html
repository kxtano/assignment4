<p>Resistance bands are versatile tools that can increase your strength and flexibility. They are great for adding resistance to bodyweight exercises and can be used for many workouts.</p>

	<p>A pull-up bar is a great piece of equipment for your upper body strength. It allows you to perform pull-ups, chin-ups, and other exercises that target the back, arms, and shoulders. Honestly, this is my personal favorite and this is what I use the most, mainly because I use it to do different pushups and pull-ups. The pull-up bar is tied in terms of versatility with resistance bands.</p>

	<p>By the way, these two are the most affordable options for someone who wants to get in shape and is just starting out, this is all I use and I can say that it works just fine.</p>
